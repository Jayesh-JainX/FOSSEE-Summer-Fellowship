# FOSSEE Summer Fellowship 2024 - Web Development Screening Task üåü

## Project Overview
This project involves converting a static website for the Open Source Hardware IoT GIS Hackathon into the Astro framework. The goal is to leverage Astro's modern features and optimizations to improve the performance and structure of the website. The website is currently hosted at [![Hosted Website](https://img.shields.io/badge/Website-iot--gis--hackathon-blue)](https://iot-gis-hackathon.netlify.app/).

## How to Run the Project Locally üöÄ
1. **Clone the repository**: Clone the project repository from GitHub to your local machine.

    git clone https://github.com/Jayesh-JainX/FOSSEE-Summer-Fellowship.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**: Change to the project directory.

    ```bash
    cd FOSSEE-Summer-Fellowship
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**: Use your preferred package manager to install dependencies. You can use `npm` or `yarn`.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    Or

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

4. **Start the development server**: Start the development server to view the project locally.

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    Or

    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```

5. **Open in browser**: The project should be running locally at `http://localhost:4321/`. Open this URL in your web browser to view the website.

## Project Details
- **Astro Code**: I used the Astro framework to build the website, leveraging its modern features to generate static HTML at build time. This optimization helps improve the website's performance and loading speed.
- **Components**: The website's structure is based on Astro's components and layout features. I created separate components for different sections such as the header, main menu, hero section, content sections, and footer.
- **Responsive Design**: I ensured the website is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to various devices and screen sizes.
- **Performance Optimization**: I optimized the website using Astro's features, resulting in fast load times and a smooth user experience.
- **Code Quality**: I wrote clean, maintainable, and well-commented code following best practices and coding conventions.

## Challenges Faced ü§î
- **Challenges and Solutions**: One of the key challenges I faced was understanding Astro's component-based architecture and its layout system. However, by exploring Astro's documentation and experimenting with different implementations, I was able to effectively integrate the framework and create an organized, efficient project structure.
